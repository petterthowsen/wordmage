# WordMage Enhancement TODO

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Thematic Vowel Constraint ✅ DONE
- ✅ Add `thematic_vowel : String?` property to WordSpec
- ✅ Implement validation in `generate_with_*` methods to ensure last vowel matches
- ✅ Add `with_thematic_vowel(vowel)` method to GeneratorBuilder
- ✅ Test with examples like "thranas", "kona", "tenask"

### 2. Starts With Sequence Constraint ✅ DONE
- ✅ Add `starts_with : String?` property to WordSpec  
- ✅ Implement prefix generation in Generator to force specific opening sequence
- ✅ Add `starting_with_sequence(sequence)` method to GeneratorBuilder
- ✅ Test with examples like "thra" -> "thraesy", "thranor"

### 3. Ends With Sequence Constraint ✅ DONE
- ✅ Add `ends_with : String?` property to WordSpec
- ✅ Implement suffix generation in Generator to force specific ending sequence
- ✅ Add `ending_with_sequence(sequence)` method to GeneratorBuilder
- ✅ Test with examples like words ending with "ath", "orn", etc.

### 4. Gemination Support ✅ DONE
- ✅ Add `gemination_probability : Float32` property to Generator
- ✅ Implement gemination logic in syllable generation (consonant doubling)
- ✅ Add `with_gemination_probability(prob)` to GeneratorBuilder
- ✅ Detect gemination patterns in Analyzer and WordAnalyzer
- ✅ Add gemination frequency to Analysis output

### 5. Vowel Lengthening Support ✅ DONE
- ✅ Add `vowel_lengthening_probability : Float32` property to Generator
- ✅ Implement vowel lengthening in syllable generation (vowel doubling/extension)
- ✅ Add `with_vowel_lengthening_probability(prob)` to GeneratorBuilder  
- ✅ Detect vowel lengthening in Analyzer and WordAnalyzer
- ✅ Add vowel lengthening frequency to Analysis output

### 6. Analysis Enhancement ✅ DONE
- ✅ Update WordAnalyzer to detect and count gemination occurrences
- ✅ Update WordAnalyzer to detect and count vowel lengthening occurrences
- ✅ Add gemination and lengthening stats to Analysis class
- ✅ Update JSON serialization to include new phonological features

### 7. GeneratorBuilder Integration ✅ DONE
- ✅ Add all new constraint methods to GeneratorBuilder
- ✅ Add gemination and vowel lengthening configuration methods
- ✅ Ensure new features work with analysis-based generation
- ✅ Add automatic detection of gemination/lengthening from word samples

### 8. Convenience Methods ✅ DONE
- ✅ Add `enable_gemination()` / `disable_gemination()` (sets probability to 1.0/0.0)
- ✅ Add `enable_vowel_lengthening()` / `disable_vowel_lengthening()`
- ✅ Constraint combinations work properly (tested thematic vowel + ends_with)

## 🔄 REMAINING TASKS

### 9. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for all new constraint types
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty sequences, invalid constraints, etc.)
- [ ] Update example-elvish.cr with demonstrations of new features
- [ ] Performance testing with complex constraint combinations

## 🎯 WHAT'S NEXT?

We've successfully completed **ALL** the core planned features! The constraint and phonological system is now very powerful and flexible. Here are the next options:

### Option A: Polish & Testing 🧪
- Write comprehensive test suite covering all new features
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Update examples to showcase new capabilities

### Option B: Advanced Features 🚀
- Multiple thematic vowels (alternating patterns)
- Conditional constraints (if X then Y)
- Morpheme-aware generation (prefix/root/suffix structure)
- Stress pattern constraints

### Option C: Performance & Architecture 🏗️
- Optimize constraint satisfaction algorithms
- Profile performance with complex constraints
- Refactor for better maintainability

### 10. Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Multiple thematic vowels (alternating patterns)
- [ ] Conditional constraints (if X then Y)
- [ ] Morpheme-aware generation (prefix/root/suffix structure)
- [ ] Stress pattern constraints

## Implementation Order

1. **Start Simple**: Thematic vowel (simplest validation)
2. **Sequence Constraints**: Starts/ends with (prefix/suffix logic)  
3. **Phonological Features**: Gemination and vowel lengthening
4. **Analysis Integration**: Detection and statistics
5. **Builder Methods**: Fluent API integration
6. **Testing & Examples**: Comprehensive validation

## Technical Notes

- All constraints should be optional (nil-safe)
- Constraints should compose nicely (multiple can be active)
- Generator should retry if constraints can't be satisfied
- Analysis should provide recommendations for constraint usage
- Performance impact should be minimal for unused features
